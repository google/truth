/**
 * Defines what to do when a check fails.
 *
 * <p>This type does not appear directly in a fluent assertion chain, but you choose a {@code
 * FailureStrategy} by choosing which method to call at the beginning of the chain.
 *
 * <p>Built-in strategies include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain Truth#assert_ assertions}
 *   <li>{@linkplain Expect expectations}
 *   <li>{@linkplain TruthJUnit#assume assumptions}
 *   <li>(and some useful only to people who implement custom subjects, described below)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For more information about the fluent chain, see <a href="https://google.github.io/truth/faq#full-chain">this
 * FAQ entry</a>.
 *
 * <h3>For people extending Truth</h3>
 *
 * <p>Custom {@code FailureStrategy} implementations are unusual. If you think you need one,
 * consider these alternatives:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>To test a custom subject, use {@link ExpectFailure}.
 *   <li>To create subjects for other objects related to your actual value (for chained assertions),
 *       use {@link Subject#check}, which preserves the existing {@code FailureStrategy} and other
 *       context.
 *   <li>To return a no-op subject after a previous assertion has failed (for chained assertions),
 *       use {@link Subject#ignoreCheck}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When you really do need to create your own strategy, prefer to extend {@link
 * AbstractFailureStrategy} rather than this class directly. And rather than expose your {@code
 * FailureStrategy} instance to users, expose a {@link StandardSubjectBuilder} instance using {@link
 * StandardSubjectBuilder#forCustomFailureStrategy
 * StandardSubjectBuilder.forCustomFailureStrategy(STRATEGY)}.
