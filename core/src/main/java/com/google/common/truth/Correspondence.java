/**
 * Determines whether an instance of type {@code A} corresponds in some way to an instance of type
 * {@code E} for the purposes of a test assertion. For example, the implementation returned by the
 * {@link #tolerance(double)} factory method implements approximate equality between numeric values,
 * with values being said to correspond if the difference between them is does not exceed some fixed
 * tolerance. The instances of type {@code A} are typically actual values from a collection returned
 * by the code under test; the instances of type {@code E} are typically expected values with which
 * the actual values are compared by the test.
 *
 * <p>The correspondence is required to be consistent: for any given values {@code actual} and
 * {@code expected}, multiple invocations of {@code compare(actual, expected)} must consistently
 * return {@code true} or consistently return {@code false} (provided that neither value is
 * modified). Although {@code A} and {@code E} will often be the same types, they are <i>not</i>
 * required to be the same, and even if they are it is <i>not</i> required that the correspondence
 * should have any of the other properties of an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry, or
 * transitivity).
 *
 * <p>Optionally, instances of this class can also provide functionality to format the difference
 * between values which do not correspond. This results in failure messages including formatted
 * diffs between expected and actual value, where possible.
 *
 * <p>The recommended approach for creating an instance of this class is to use one of the static
 * factory methods. The most general of these is {@link #from}; the other methods are more
 * convenient in specific cases. The optional diff-formatting functionality can be added using
 * {@link #formattingDiffsUsing}. (Alternatively, you can subclass this class yourself, but that is
 * generally not recommended.)
 *
 * <p>Instances of this are typically used via {@link IterableSubject#comparingElementsUsing},
 * {@link MapSubject#comparingValuesUsing}, or {@link MultimapSubject#comparingValuesUsing}.

   * <h3>Exception handling</h3>
   *
   * <p>Throwing a {@link RuntimeException} from this method indicates that this {@link
   * Correspondence} cannot compare the given values. Any assertion which encounters such an
   * exception during the course of evaluating its condition must not pass. However, an assertion is
   * not required to invoke this method for every pair of values in its input just in order to check
   * for exceptions, if it is able to evaluate its condition without doing so.
   *
   * <h4>Conventions for handling exceptions</h4>
   *
   * <p>(N.B. This section is only really of interest when implementing assertion methods that call
   * {@link Correspondence#compare}, not to users making such assertions in their tests.)
   *
   * <p>The only requirement on an assertion is that, if it encounters an exception from this
   * method, it must not pass. The simplest implementation choice is simply to allow the exception
   * to propagate. However, it is normally more helpful to catch the exception and instead fail with
   * a message which includes more information about the assertion in progress and the nature of the
   * failure.
   *
   * <p>By convention, an assertion may catch and store the exception and continue evaluating the
   * condition as if the method had returned false instead of throwing. If the assertion's condition
   * does not hold with this alternative behaviour, it may choose to fail with a message that gives
   * details about how the condition does not hold, additionally mentioning that assertions were
   * encountered and giving details about one of the stored exceptions. (See the first example
   * below.) If the assertion's condition does hold with this alternative behaviour, the requirement
   * that the assertion must not pass still applies, so it should fail with a message giving details
   * about one of the stored exceptions. (See the second and third examples below.)
   *
   * <p>This behaviour is only a convention and should only be implemented when it makes sense to do
   * so. In particular, in an assertion that has multiple stages, it may be better to only continue
   * evaluation to the end of the current stage, and fail citing a stored exception at the end of
   * the stage, rather than accumulating exceptions through the multiple stages.
   *
   * <h4>Examples of exception handling</h4>
   *
   * <p>Suppose that we have the correspondence
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * static final Correspondence<String, String> CASE_INSENSITIVE_EQUALITY =
   *     Correspondence.from(String::equalsIgnoreCase, "equals ignoring case"}
   * }</pre>
   *
   * whose {@code compare} method throws {@link NullPointerException} if the actual value is null.
   * The assertion
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * assertThat(asList(null, "xyz", "abc", "def"))
   *     .comparingElementsUsing(CASE_INSENSITIVE_EQUALITY)
   *     .containsExactly("ABC", "DEF", "GHI", "JKL");
   * }</pre>
   *
   * may fail saying that the actual iterable contains unexpected values {@code null} and {@code
   * xyz} and is missing values corresponding to {@code GHI} and {@code JKL}, which is what it would
   * do if the {@code compare} method returned false instead of throwing, and additionally mention
   * the exception. (This is more helpful than allowing the {@link NullPointerException} to
   * propagate to the caller, or than failing with only a description of the exception.)
   *
   * <p>However, the assertions
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * assertThat(asList(null, "xyz", "abc", "def"))
   *     .comparingElementsUsing(CASE_INSENSITIVE_EQUALITY)
   *     .doesNotContain("MNO");
   * }</pre>
   *
   * and
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * assertThat(asList(null, "xyz", "abc", "def"))
   *     .comparingElementsUsing(CASE_INSENSITIVE_EQUALITY)
   *     .doesNotContain(null);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * must both fail citing the exception, even though they would pass if the {@code compare} method
   * returned false. (Note that, in the latter case at least, it is likely that the test author's
   * intention was <i>not</i> for the test to pass with these values.)
