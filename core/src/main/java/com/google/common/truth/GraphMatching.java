     *   <li>This modification results in the free LHS vertex at the start of the path and the free
     *       RHS vertex at the end of the path becoming non-free, while the intermediate non-free
     *       vertices stay non-free.
     *   <li>None of the edges used in this search path may be used in any further DFS. They cannot
     *       be used in the same direction as they were in this DFS because their directions are
     *       flipped; and they cannot be used in their new directions because we only use edges
     *       leading to the next layer of the BFS and, after flipping the directions, these edges
     *       now lead to the previous layer.
     *   <li>As a consequence of the previous property, repeated invocations of this method will
     *       find only paths which were used in the BFS and which were not used in any previous DFS
     *       (i.e. the set of edges used in the paths found by repeated DFSes are disjoint).
     * </ul>
