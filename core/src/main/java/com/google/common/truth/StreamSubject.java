/**
 * Propositions for {@link Stream} subjects.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> When you perform an assertion based on the <i>contents</i> of the stream, or when
 * <i>any</i> assertion <i>fails</i>, the wrapped stream will be drained immediately into a private
 * collection to provide more readable failure messages. This consumes the stream. Take care if you
 * intend to leave the stream un-consumed or if the stream is <i>very</i> large or infinite.
 *
 * <p>If you intend to make multiple assertions on the contents of the same stream, you should
 * instead first collect the contents of the stream into a collection and then assert directly on
 * that.
 *
 * <p>For very large or infinite streams you may want to first {@linkplain Stream#limit limit} the
 * stream before asserting on it.
