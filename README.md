## What is Truth?

Truth makes your [test assertions] and [failure messages] more readable.
[Similar][comparison] to [AssertJ], it [natively supports][known_types] many JDK
and [Guava] types, and it is [extensible][extension] to others.

Truth is owned and maintained by the [Guava] team. It is used in the majority
of the tests in Google’s own codebase.
