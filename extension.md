title: Extensions to Truth
---


## Extension points

Truth is configurable in multiple ways, including:

*   custom failure behaviors
*   custom correspondences
*   custom assertion methods

Custom failure behaviors can be useful, as can the alternative built-in
behaviors. For information about both, see [`FailureStrategy`].

Custom correspondences are useful for testing whether a collection contains a
value that is "similar to" an expected value. For more information, see
[`Correspondence`].

But when people talk about Truth extensions, they're usually referring to custom
assertion methods, implemented on a custom [`Subject`] subclass. That's what
we'll cover in the rest of this page.

## Subjects provided in Truth extensions

Some subjects aren't part of core Truth but can be found in other parts of the
project. They include:

*   [`Truth8`] for java8 types such as `java.util.Optional`
*   [`ProtoTruth`] for `Message` style protocol buffers and lite versions
*   [`Re2jSubjects`] for use with the RE2J library

Other extensions that are not part of the Truth project itself include:

*   [AndroidX Test](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/fundamentals#assertions)
    for testing Android types, like `Intent`
*   [Compile Testing] for testing annotation processors and compilation jobs


## Using subjects from extensions

The steps are nearly the same as [for using the core Truth assertions](index):

### 1. Add the appropriate dependency to your build file

Each extension is packaged separately so you can include only what you need.

* Java 8: `com.google.truth.extensions:truth-java8-extension:{{ site.version }}`
* Protocol Buffers: `com.google.truth.extensions:truth-proto-extension:{{ site.version }}`
  * LiteProto: `com.google.truth.extensions:truth-liteproto-extension:{{ site.version }}`
* RE2J: `com.google.truth.extensions:truth-re2j-extension:{{ site.version }}`


### 2. Add a static import

For example:

```java
import static com.google.common.truth.extensions.proto.ProtoTruth.assertThat;
```

It's fine to also statically import `Truth.assertThat` in the same file, as the
methods have different signatures.

### 3. Write a test assertion using the static import

```java
assertThat(protoBuilder).hasAllRequiredFields();
```

If you need to set a failure message or use a different [`FailureStrategy`],
you'll instead need to find the extension's [`Subject.Factory`]. For an
extension named `FooSubject`, the factory is usually `FooSubject.foos()`. In the
case of the Protocol Buffers extension, it's `ProtoTruth.protos()`. So, to use
the [`expect`] `FailureStrategy` and provide an additional message in a check
about Protocol Buffers, you would write:

```java
import static com.google.common.truth.extensions.proto.ProtoTruth.protos;
import com.google.common.truth.Expect;
...
@Rule public final Expect expect = Expect.create();
...
expect
    .withMessage("fields not copied from input %s", input)
    .about(protos())
    .that(myBuilder)
    .hasAllRequiredFields();
```

But in most cases you'll use shortcuts, either `assertThat(...)` or
`assertWithMessage(...).about(...).that(...)`. For more information about the
available shortcuts, see [this FAQ entry][shortcuts].

## Writing your own custom subject

For an example of how to support custom types in Truth, please see the [employee
example]. The rest of this doc will walk through each of the files, step by
step.

There are four parts to the example:

1.  [`Employee.java`]

    This is the *class under test*. There's really nothing exciting about this
    file. In this case, it's just a plain old Java object (*POJO*), implemented
    using [`@AutoValue`].

2.  [`EmployeeSubject.java`]

    This is the custom Truth subject, and the most interesting part of this
    example. There are several
    important things to note about this file:

    1.  Every custom subject must extend [`Subject`] or one of its subclasses.
        Your class definition will usually look like this:

        ```java
        public final class EmployeeSubject extends Subject {...}
        ```

        The class must be accessible to the tests that will use it. Typically
        that means making it `public`.

        We suggest making the class `final` for simplicity, but it's fine to
        make it extensible if you find that useful.

        Tip: What if your `Subject` class has a type parameter, like
        [`ComparableSubject`]? Follow our instructions for
        [`CustomSubjectBuilder`](custom_subject_builder) instead of step 2
        below, and then return to the instructions at step 3.

    2.  A subject also needs to define a [`Subject.Factory`], exposed through a
        static method. The definition is usually boilerplate:

        ```java
        public static Factory<EmployeeSubject, Employee> employees() {
          return EmployeeSubject::new;
        }
        ```

        Like your `Subject` class itself, this static method must be accessible
        to the tests that will use it―typically, `public`.

        We recommend naming this method in the *plural form* (e.g.,
        `EmployeeSubject.employees()`, `PersonSubject.people()`, etc.). We
        recommend putting this method on your `Subject` class itself.

        By passing your `Subject.Factory` to an `about()` method, users can
        perform all the operations that they expect of a built-in `Subject`
        type. For example, they can set a failure message:

        ```java
        import static com.google.common.truth.extension.EmployeeSubject.employees;
        ...
        assertWithMessage("findClosestMatch should have found user with given username")
            .about(employees())
            .that(db.findClosestMatch("kak"))
            .hasUsername("kak");
        ```

        But users won't need those operations most of the time, so offer them a
        shortcut:

    3.  For users' convenience, define a static `assertThat(Employee)` shortcut
        method:

        ```java
        public static EmployeeSubject assertThat(@Nullable Employee actual) {
          return assertAbout(employees()).that(actual);
        }
        ```

        Like your `Subject`, your `assertThat` method must be accessible to the
        tests that will use it―typically, `public`.

        We recommend putting this method on your `Subject` class itself. Or, if
        your library defines multiple `Subject` subclasses, you may wish to
        create a single class (like [`Truth8`]) that contains all your
        `assertThat` methods so that users can access them all with a single
        static import.

        Users can statically import your method alongside Truth's `assertThat`
        methods. Static imports with the same name follow the same
        overload-resolution rules as normal Java overloads, so the imports can
        coexist unless in a file unless it makes a call that's ambiguous.

        (If your users do end up with an ambiguous reference, they can instead
        use the `Subject.Factory` (`assertAbout(employees()).that(...)`) or use
        the `assertThat` method without static imports
        (`EmployeeSubject.assertThat(...)`).)

    4.  Your custom `Subject` class must have a constructor that accepts a
        [`FailureMetadata`] and a reference to the *instance under test*. Store
        a reference to the instance, and pass both to the superclass
        constructor:

        ```java
        @Nullable private final Employee actual;

        private EmployeeSubject(FailureMetadata metadata, @Nullable Employee actual) {
          super(metadata, actual);
          this.actual = actual;
        }
        ```

        If your `Subject` is `final`, the constructor can be `private`. But even
        if you want an extensible `Subject`, there's no reason for the
        constructor to be `public`, only package-private or `protected`: No one
        should call the constructor directly except the `Subject.Factory` and
        subclasses.

    5.  Finally, you define your test assertion API on the custom `Subject`.
        Since you're defining the API, you can write it however you'd like.
        However, we recommend method names that will make the assertions read
        like English sentences. For some advice on naming assertion methods,
        please see [this FAQ entry](faq#assertion-naming).

        As for the implementation: Most assertion implementations employ one of
        the two basic approaches. The simpler approach is to delegate to an
        existing assertion. To do so, use `Subject.check(...)`, which preserves
        the caller-specified `FailureStrategy` and other context. For example:

        ```java
        public void hasName(String name) {
          check("name()").that(actual.name()).isEqualTo(name);
        }
        ```

        This gives Truth enough information to construct a failure message like:

        ```none
        value of    : employee.name()
        expected    : Sundar Pichai
        but was     : Kurt Alfred Kluever
        employee was: Employee{username=kak, name=Kurt Alfred Kluever, isCeo=false}
        ```

        But sometimes you can't delegate to an existing assertion. Or you could,
        but the failure message would be poor. In such cases, you can take the
        other approach -- manually perform your check and report a failure. For
        example:

        ```java
        public void isCeo() {
          if (!actual.isCeo()) {
            failWithActual(simpleFact("expected to be CEO"));
          }
        }
        ```

        This lets Truth produce a failure message like:

        ```none
        expected to be CEO
        but was: Employee{username=kak, name=Kurt Alfred Kluever, isCeo=false}
        ```

        This message contains all the relevant information, yet it's much
        shorter than the `hasName(...)` example above. This is possible because
        `isCeo()` is testing a boolean property. Boolean properties are good
        candidates for the manual check-and-fail approach.

        For tips on writing failure messages, see
        [this guide](failure_messages).

        One advanced point: Custom `Subject` types sometimes declare "chaining"
        methods that return an instance of another `Subject`. For example,
        instead of providing `hasName(...)`, `EmployeeSubject` might declare a
        `EmployeeSubject.name()` method that returns a `StringSubject` for the
        value of `employee.name()`. To create such "chained" subjects, use
        `Subject.check(...)`, as above, and return the `Subject` you create:

        ```java
        public StringSubject name() {
          return check("name()").that(actual.name());
        }
        ```

        Now callers can write:

        ```java
        assertThat(kak).name().matches("Kurt .*Kluever");
        ```

3.  [`EmployeeSubjectTest.java`]

    This is a test of the subject, which tests that its assertions pass when
    they should and fail when they should:

    ```java
    import static com.google.common.truth.ExpectFailure.expectFailureAbout;
    import static com.google.common.truth.extension.EmployeeSubject.assertThat;
    import static com.google.common.truth.extension.EmployeeSubject.employees;

    import com.google.common.truth.ExpectFailure.SimpleSubjectBuilderCallback;

    @RunWith(JUnit4.class)
    public final class EmployeeSubjectTest {
      private static final Employee KURT =
          Employee.create("kak", 37802, "Kurt Alfred Kluever", Location.NYC, false);

      @Test
      public void id() {
        assertThat(KURT).hasId(37802);
        expectFailure(whenTesting -> whenTesting.that(KURT).hasId(12345));
      }
      ...
      private static AssertionError expectFailure(
          SimpleSubjectBuilderCallback<EmployeeSubject, Employee> callback) {
        return expectFailureAbout(employees(), callback);
      }
    }
    ```

    Testing that assertions pass is easy: Just make assertions with your
    `assertThat` method.

    Testing that assertions fail is fairly easy, too, with Truth's
    [`ExpectFailure`] utility. The example above shows how to define a helper
    method to make your `ExpectFailure` calls even shorter.

    If you want to test more thoroughly, `expectFailure` returns an
    `AssertionError`, so you can write:

    ```java
    import static com.google.common.truth.ExpectFailure.assertThat;

    assertThat(failure).factValue("value of").isEqualTo("employee.username()");
    ```

    `ExpectFailure` also provides an API for users who can't use lambdas. See
    its docs for details.

4.  [`FakeHrDatabaseTest.java`]

    This is an example of how your unit tests will look using your custom Truth
    subject. The important thing to note is that you import both
    `Truth.assertThat` and `EmployeeSubject.assertThat`:

    ```java
    import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat;
    import static com.google.common.truth.extension.EmployeeSubject.assertThat;
    ```

    You can use your subject alongside the core Truth subjects:

    ```java
    // "normal" Truth
    assertThat(db.get(SUNDAR.id())).isNull();

    // uses the custom EmployeeSubject
    db.relocate(KURT.id(), MTV);
    assertThat(db.get(KURT.id())).hasLocation(MTV);
    ```
